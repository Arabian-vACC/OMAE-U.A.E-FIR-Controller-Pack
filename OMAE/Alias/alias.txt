.ifl Hello, it appears you have an invalid flight level. According to the semicircular rule, flight levels are assigned based on the direction of flight, with odd levels (e.g., FL 310, FL 330) used for flights heading east (0° to 179°), and even levels (e.g., FL 300, FL 320) used for flights heading west (180° to 359°). Your new cruise level has been changed to FL$1 to comply with this rule.

.tatl .msg $aircraft Hello, the transition altitude within the Emiates FIR is 13,000ft and the transition level is FL150. When flying at/or below the transition altitude you must set the LOCAL QNH which is given to you by the controller or the ATIS and refer to all altitudes in thousands of FEET. When flying at/or above the transition level you must set STANDARD PRESSURE (1013.25 hPa) on your altimeter. These levels are referred to as FLIGHT LEVELS. Thank you Captain!
