.cr .msg $aircraft Please make a correct readback so that I see that you've understood my instructions correctly. A readback is made by repeating the instructions of the controller. 
.po .msg $aircraft Hello, the position you are standing is already occupied by another aircraft. Please choose another one, thank you!
.fp .msg $aircraft Hello. Your IFR flight plan is not valid. Your flight plan likely doesn't comply with Middle Eastern routing restrictions. For more information, check out library.arabian-vacc.com or email whyamigettingrerouted@vatsim.me.

.exs .msg $aircraft Hello, expect Stand $1, Happy Landing!
.xp .msg $aircraft It seems you are using XPlane with inappropriate graphic settings. Your computer is not able to render the requested number of frames in time thus slowing down your simulator. Please adjust your graphic settings to increase the frame rate.
.ica .msg $aircraft A kind reminder: please comply with the initial altitude you were given within your clearance. This may have been included with the SID you were given.
.tatl .msg $aircraft Hello, the transition altitude within the Emiates FIR is 13,000ft and the transition level is FL150. When flying at/or below the transition altitude you must set the LOCAL QNH which is given to you by the controller or the ATIS and refer to all altitudes in thousands of FEET. When flying at/or above the transition level you must set STANDARD PRESSURE (1013.25 hPa) on your altimeter. These levels are referred to as FLIGHT LEVELS. Thank you Captain!
